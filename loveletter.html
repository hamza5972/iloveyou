            <p>
                I love you, you know that. I can kill for you and I know that. You think you know how much i love you
                but you actually dont. I love you like crazy, alot, infinite, dher saraaaaaa. I care for you, youve been
                the best part of my life and I have been telling you this since the day we met. If you ever face any
                problem just let me know we'll deal with it together. Oh and how I wish you were here so that I could
                wrap my arms around you and kiss you on your head every time you tell me you are tired. I love you a
                little
                bit more everyday. Who knows where we will end up, I just hope in the end you will be with me.
            </p>

                With all my love,<br>
